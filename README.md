# Restaurant Booking App

The restaurant booking app will allow users to choose and book a table with their favorite restaurants in the nearby area.
It will provide a view (and a map) of the inside of the restaurant.
Users can see which tables are already booked and which are available, and they can book the table.
The app will contain menus, table availability, and recommendations and reviews about the restaurant and the food they serve.
